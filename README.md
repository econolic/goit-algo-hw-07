# Binary Search Tree (BST) and AVL Tree (`bst_avl.py`)

## Description

This Python script provides implementations of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an Adelson-Velsky and Landis (AVL) tree. It includes functionalities for insertion, finding the minimum and maximum values, and calculating the sum of all node values. The script also features a benchmarking utility to compare the performance of these operations (`get_max`, `get_min`, `get_sum`) between BST and AVL trees, with results visualized using `matplotlib`.

## Features

* **Binary Search Tree (BST):**
    * `insert(value)`: Inserts a value into the tree.
    * `get_max()`: Returns the maximum value in the tree.
    * `get_min()`: Returns the minimum value in the tree.
    * `get_sum()`: Returns the sum of all values in the tree.
    * Handles duplicate values by incrementing a `count` attribute on the existing node.
* **AVL Tree:**
    * `insert(value)`: Inserts a value into the tree, maintaining AVL balance properties through rotations.
    * `get_max()`: Returns the maximum value in the tree.
    * `get_min()`: Returns the minimum value in the tree.
    * `get_sum()`: Returns the sum of all values in the tree.
    * `verify_avl_property()`: Checks if the tree maintains AVL properties (balance factor of each node is -1, 0, or 1).
    * Handles duplicate values by incrementing a `count` attribute on the existing node.
* **Benchmarking:**
    * Compares the execution time of `get_max`, `get_min`, and `get_sum` operations for BST and AVL trees.
    * Uses a dataset of `n` random integers (default `n=100,000`).
    * Visualizes benchmark results using a bar chart generated by `matplotlib`.
* **Testing:**
    * Includes inline assertions within the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to verify the correctness of tree operations for various scenarios, including handling of duplicates and single-element trees.

## Tree Operations Complexity:
- **BST**: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case
- **AVL**: O(log n) guaranteed for all operations

# Hierarchical Comment System (`comment_system.py`)

## Description

A simple hierarchical commenting system in Python. It allows for creating comments, replying to comments (thereby forming a tree structure), "soft" deleting comments, displaying the comment hierarchy, and performing some basic queries like counting replies and finding comments by a specific author.

## Features

* **Comment Class:**
    * `__init__(text, author)`: Creates a new comment with specified text and author.
    * `add_reply(reply)`: Adds a nested reply to the current comment with type validation.
    * `remove_reply()`: Marks comment as deleted, replacing text with deletion message and clearing author information while preserving reply hierarchy.
    * `display(indent_level=0)`: Recursively displays the comment tree with proper indentation to show hierarchical structure.
    * `get_reply_count()`: Returns total count of all replies in the comment subtree.
    * `find_replies_by_author(author)`: Searches for all non-deleted replies by a specific author within the comment hierarchy.

* **Key Features:**
    * **Hierarchical Structure**: Supports unlimited nesting depth for comment replies.
    * **Soft Deletion**: Deleted comments preserve their position in the hierarchy while hiding author information.
    * **Type Safety**: Full type hints for better code maintainability and IDE support.
    * **Search Functionality**: Built-in methods for finding comments by author and counting replies.
    * **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes unit tests to verify all functionality.

* **Use Cases:**
    * Forum discussion systems
    * Social media comment threads
    * Code review comment systems
    * Documentation feedback systems

## Comment System Complexity:
- **Add Reply**: O(1)
- **Remove Reply**: O(1)
- **Display**: O(n) where n is total comments
- **Search by Author**: O(n)
- **Count Replies**: O(n)
